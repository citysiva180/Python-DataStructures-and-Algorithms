# In this section we would be dealing with multiple Topics Such as 

# Default dictionary 
# Counter 
# Deque 
# NamedTuple 
# Chain Map 
# OrderedDict 


# Default dictionary helps in initiating a
# dictionary without any keys 
# A normal dictionary will be empty without keys 
# But a default dictionary will assign keys automatically
